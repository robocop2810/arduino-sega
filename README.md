<h1 align="center">Arduino-gameconsole<h1>
a game-console built on a adafruit metro m0 with an 32x32 rgb matrix and original sega controllers

## The project
  I made this for my thesis project (10'th grade).

  It was fully built and coded by myself, i worked about 5 months on this project.
  I only used one library, RGBmatrixPanel this library is used to control the display.







## Ideas?
  If you have any ideas for things i could add to this game-console?
  Feel free to contact me!
